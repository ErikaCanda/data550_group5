## Initial code description

`alex/code/01_make_table1.R`
  - makes table 1
  - saves table 1 as a `.rds` object in `alex/output/`

`erika/code/02_make_figure1.R`
  - makes a boxplot for continuous variables such as MUAC, weight, height to 
    compare differences over time
  - saves the boxplot as a `.rds` object in `erika/output/`

`erika/code/03_make_figure2.R`
  - makes a stacked bar chart for binary variables such as age, sex, and 
    presence of edema to compare differences over time
  - saves the bar chart as a `.rds` object in `erika/output/`

`tina/code/04_regression_figure1.R`
  - runs a regression analysis where days to stabilization is the outcome and 
    treatment arm is the main predictor
  - creates a figure that describes the model and saves it as a `.rds` object
    in `tina/output/`
  
`tina/code/05_regression_figure2.R`
  - creates a scatterplot with the regression line
  - saves the scatterplot as a `.rds` object in `tina/output/`
  
`afia/code/06_make_figure3.R`
- conducts additional analyses based on stratifying variables of interest with
determined cutoffs
- saves the figure as a `.rds` object in `afia/output/`
